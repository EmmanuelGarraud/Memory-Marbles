## Presentation :
A tank allows the memories of a digital creature to be stored into transparent spheres/marbles.
When a memory is recent, it's spheres emits a strong light that fades over time.
This program simulates the creation of memories (one by one) in this tank.
The simulator allows the recall of a chosen memory by re-injecting light into it.

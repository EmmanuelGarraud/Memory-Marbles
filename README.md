## Presentation :
A tank allows the memories of a digital creature to be stored into transparent spheres/marbles.
When a memory is recent, it's spheres emits a strong light that fades over time.
This program simulates the creation of memories (one by one) in this tank.
The simulator allows the recall of a chosen memory by re-injecting light into it.

## Working :
- Open Memory Marbles project with Unity editor version 2020.3.4f1 (LTS)
- Open the scene 'MemoryMarbleScene' in Assets/MEMORY MARBLES/Scenes
- You have the possibility to modify several settings on the asset MarbleDatasManager in Assets/MEMORY MARBLES/MarbleDatas
These parameters can be modified both in edit mode and in runtime mode.
- Launch it by pressing the play button or Ctrl/Cmd + P
- The 'Create Marble' button allows you to create Memory Marbles
- The 'Re-inject' button allows to reactivate the light on a defined Marble
- The Dropdown box allows the selection of a Marble that has been created (to then reinject light into it)
- Bonus: With the mouse you can turn around the tank by left click and zoom with the scroll wheel
- Enjoy!

## More infos :
- The AZIMUTH package, which I created in 2017, was used for camera management.
- 3D objects were created with Cinema4D software and also imported from DAZ Studio.
- The textures were created and/or formatted with Photoshop.
- The tank can hold up to approximately 3200 Marbles.
- Setting up this project and its code and README file took me about 2h30.
  (If the deadline defined (2h) for its realization had not been limited (and exceeded) I would have continued)
